# Brain-Tumor-classification
This research utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with MRI images to effectively categorize tumours. In this study, 1877 MR images (including three sequences, T1-W, T2-W and FLAIR images) are classified into four different categories such as glioma tumour, meningioma tumour, no tumour and pituitary tumourThe EfficientNet-B1 model proposed in this study leveraged augmented tumor data to improve accuracy. The experiment consisted of 25 epochs, utilizing a batch size of 32, image dimensions of 240 pixels, and verbosity set to 1. In terms of model accuracy, the initial validation accuracy was approximately 0.75, but after the first epoch, it notably surged to around 0.82. Similarly, the initial validation loss exceeded 0.49, but after one epoch, it decreased to below 0.40. Figure 3 illustrates a positive trend wherein accuracy improves, and loss diminishes. Although the initial validation accuracy was modest, it progressively reached nearly 98 percent. The proposed model, EfficientNet B1, demonstrated a validation dataset accuracy of 98%,
